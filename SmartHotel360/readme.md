# Accelerating DevOps 

Agile software delivery is key because it helps organizations innovate faster and gets new software in the hands of consumers sooner. This requires new, more productive ways of working for enterprise IT teams. Development teams have already undergone several “transformations” in recent years, from the siloed waterfall approach to agile methodology and now DevOps. Software is the true differentiator in the age of digital transformation, and many companies are using DevOps to ensure their software meets the standard.

In this demo, we will walk you through how SmartHotel 360, a fictitious hotel, used DevOps practices to fuel their digital transformation journey by accelerating software and services delivery

The SmartHotel360 team works off of a backlog of requirements or “user stories” in VSTS. The backlog is prioritized so the most important user stories are at the top. The product owner owns the backlog and adds, changes, and reprioritizes user stories based on the customer’s needs.
